In this project, I developed an SIR model to predict COVID-19 incidence counts based on mortality data using the MCMC
algorithm. After that, I evaluated model performance with time-series cross-validation and visualized training and validation results, and applied a synthetic control method to evaluate the effectiveness of policy interventions in addressing the pandemic.

<a href="https://github.com/xeshbeluk/network-analysis/tree/main/gfp%20mutations" target="_blank">Python code</a><br>

The purpose of the study is to explore the relationship between the maize protein protein interaction network and the fitness cost a genetic mutation. Specifically, this study explored the betweenness centrality, degree, and average neighbor degree of specific protein coding genes targeted in an unreleased prior dataset and study.

<a href="https://github.com/xeshbeluk/battleships-game-analysis" target="_blank">R code</a><br>

Battleships  a strategy-type guessing game for two players, played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships is marked. Before the start, players deploy their ships of different sizes on the grid, and the locations of the fleets are concealed from the other players. Players are trying to guess the location of enemy ships and hit them by taking turns. In this simulation project, I am investigating the most efficient ship placement strategies that would increase the chances of survival.
